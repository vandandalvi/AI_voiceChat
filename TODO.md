## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations (Current Version)

### Speech-to-Text
- [ ] **IMPORTANT**: Current version uses placeholder for STT

- [ ] To fix: See "Optional Enhancements" below

---

## üîß Optional Enhancements

### Option A: Add Real Speech-to-Text (Recommended)

#### Using OpenAI Whisper
1. [ ] Get OpenAI API key
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Create account (requires credit card)
   - Add $5 minimum credits
   - Generate API key

2. [ ] Switch to Whisper version
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   # Backup current version
   move app.py app_basic.py
   # Use Whisper version
   move app_with_whisper.py app.py
   # Update requirements
   move requirements.txt requirements_basic.txt
   move requirements_with_whisper.txt requirements.txt
   # Install new dependencies
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. [ ] Add OpenAI key to `.env`
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   ```

4. [ ] Restart backend
5. [ ] Test: Your speech should now be transcribed!

#### Alternative: Use Other STT Services
See `README.md` for integration guides:
- [ ] Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
- [ ] Azure Speech Services
- [ ] Custom implementation
