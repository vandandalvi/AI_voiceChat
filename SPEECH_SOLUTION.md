# üé§ Speech Recognition Solution

## The Issue
Browser-based speech recognition shows: `Network error - speech recognition may not be available`

This happens because Chrome/Edge's Web Speech API requires internet connection to Google's servers, which may be blocked or unavailable.

## ‚úÖ The Solution: Type Mode

We've added **TWO input methods** so your app always works!

### Option 1: ‚å®Ô∏è Type Mode (RECOMMENDED - Always Works!)

1. Click **"Start Interview"** - AI greets you with voice ‚úÖ
2. Click **"‚å®Ô∏è Type Mode"** button
3. Type your response in the text box
4. Click **"Send Response"**
5. AI responds with both voice and text ‚úÖ

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Works 100% of the time (no network dependency)
- ‚úÖ More accurate than speech recognition
- ‚úÖ You can edit before sending
- ‚úÖ Still get voice responses from AI

### Option 2: üé§ Voice Mode (If Available)

1. Click **"üé§ Start Speaking"**
2. Allow microphone access
3. Speak your answer
4. Click **"‚èπÔ∏è Stop Speaking"**

**Note:** If you see the network error, voice transcription won't work. That's OK - just use Type Mode instead!
